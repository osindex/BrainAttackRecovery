## Why

LinaPro needs a formal, stable, and extensible plugin platform to support source-code plugins compiled into the host, dynamically installable WASM runtime plugins, frontend page integration, backend hook and slot extension points, permission governance, multi-node hot upgrade, and a full host-service capability model for dynamic plugins. Without a unified plugin contract, lifecycle management, runtime loading, host-service governance, startup automation, and installation UX, the system cannot sustainably extend business capabilities without invasive modifications to core code.

## What Changes

- Define a unified plugin contract with `plugin.yaml` as the entry manifest, covering source plugins under `apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/` and dynamic plugins discoverable from `plugin.dynamic.storagePath`.
- Establish the plugin lifecycle state machine: discovery, install, enable, disable, uninstall, upgrade, and hot-update, with distinct semantics for source and dynamic plugins.
- Implement dynamic WASM plugin runtime loading, including manifest validation, custom-section artifact parsing, frontend asset extraction and hosting, and `wazero`-based execution.
- Build the dynamic plugin REST runtime with route contracts extracted from `g.Meta`, fixed-prefix dispatch at `/api/v1/extensions/{pluginId}/...`, host-managed authentication and permission checks, protobuf bridge envelopes, and real WASM bridge execution with 501 fallback.
- Unify dynamic plugin resource declaration through `go:embed`, where the builder reads embedded resources and converts them to host-governable snapshot custom sections.
- Extend host-service capabilities from discrete opcodes to a structured host-service model with `runtime`, `storage`, `network`, `data`, `cache`, `lock`, `notify`, and `config` services, each with resource authorization, execution context, and audit.
- Add startup auto-enable via `plugin.autoEnable` in the host main config file, with a dedicated bootstrap phase before plugin wiring, fail-fast behavior, and cluster-aware primary-node execution. The bootstrap phase must synchronize the startup snapshot after any source plugin lifecycle write so that subsequent enable checks within the same startup orchestration read the latest installed state.
- Add an install-and-enable shortcut in the plugin installation dialog, with permission gating, partial-success messaging, and E2E coverage.
- Add mock-data installation support with `installMockData` option, transactional mock SQL execution, structured rollback errors, and startup bootstrap integration.
- Show dynamic route exposure in the authorization review dialog alongside host-service authorization, with backend route projection and collapsible route lists.
- Make plugin list queries read-only, safe metadata lookup for host-service table comments, and session activity write throttling.
- Converge cluster deployment topology: `cluster.enabled` switch, `cluster.Service` as the sole topology facade, leader election as internal implementation detail, and plugin runtime convergence via generation model.
- Unify duration configuration across `jwt.expire`, `session.timeout`, `session.cleanupInterval`, and `monitor.interval` using duration strings parsed to `time.Duration`.
- Rebuild the notification domain with `sys_notify_channel`, `sys_notify_message`, and `sys_notify_delivery` tables, replacing `sys_user_message`.
- Establish declarative permission middleware for static APIs with access context caching and topology-revision-based invalidation.
- Generalize the plugin configuration service from plugin-specific `GetMonitor()` to a business-neutral read-only accessor, keeping each plugin's configuration structure, defaults, and validation inside the plugin. Add the `config` host service for dynamic plugins.
